# JavaScript Refresher
In this exercise we will refresh some of the basics of JavaScript.

## Exercises
Save each exercise as a separate source file.

1. Download the files in this repository and open them in Brackets.

1. Open javascript.html in Firefox and open the JavaScript console.

1. Add another property to the car object, called year and give it a value of 2007. Refresh javascript.html in your browser.

1. Create a variable called jsontext in the JavaScript code that is a string containing only a pair of curly braces, delimited by single quotes.

1. Create a variable called jsonobj, which is the return value of JSON.parse called with jsontext as an argument. Check the result.

1. In jsontext, write the JSON code for an object with a single name/value pair, where the name is "breed" and the value is "labrador". Again, check the result.

1. Change the property's name to "breeds", and change its value to an array containing three strings: "labrador", "collie" and "springer".

1. Go to [JSONLint](http://jsonlint.com/), and copy and paste the contents of jsontext into the test box. Click Validate.

1. Copy and paste the output of [reddit.com/.json](http://www.reddit.com/.json) into JSONLint.
